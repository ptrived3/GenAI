# This code initializes a simple command-line chatbot that interacts with the OpenAI API to answer mathematical questions.
# It uses a strict mathematical prompt to ensure the assistant only responds to math-related queries.
# The conversation history is maintained to provide context for the assistant's responses.
# The user can exit the chat by typing 'exit' or 'quit'.
# The code handles errors gracefully and provides feedback to the user.
